## Project Information

This project was built using Node.js, allowing interaction with a PostgreSQL (PSQL) database. It follows RESTful principles and adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The API offers Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations through various endpoints and Test Driven Development (TDD) was used to ensure the code met expected outcomes.

You can use this API to view articles, topics, users and comments within the nc_news datatbase. You can retrieve articles based on specific queries, post new comments on articles and delete comments.

## Project Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
